The Noise Monitoring System is designed to continuously track and analyze sound levels in an office environment. Utilizing a Raspberry Pi and a microphone, the system captures real-time audio data and processes it to monitor decibel levels across various areas in the office. This data is displayed on a dashboard, providing visual feedback on the current noise levels. If the sound level exceeds a predefined threshold, the system triggers an alert.

The backend of the system is powered by a Flask server, which handles data processing and communication between the Raspberry Pi and the React.js-based dashboard. The project also includes a data storage component for logging days when the noise exceeds the set limits, allowing for historical analysis and long-term monitoring of the office's acoustic environment. This system aims to create a more comfortable and productive workspace by ensuring noise levels are kept within acceptable limits.
